To import data as a spatial object in R, enter this line of code into your R console,

source('path/to/AgChange/import.AgChange.R')

replacing "path/to/AgChange/" with the path to the AgChange directory on your computer.

A new SpatialPolygonsDataFrame called "counties" will now be available to your R console.

Quickly examine the data using this line of code,

summary(counties@data)
